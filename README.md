# P.A.I.N.T

(Paint...ain't it nicely tried ?)
"JS simple image editor"


## W.I.P

Do not expect much from this apart from school work and/or experiments (maybe a basis for a new version of skribbl.io aha cheers thanks again)

Still everything to be done


## Tools

- Selector
- Pencil
- Eraser
- Color Picker
- Bucket Fill


## Features

- Selector can copy paste with Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V
- You can change pencil/eraser's size
- You can change pencil/eraser's color
- You can save your image as PNG
- You can move the toolbox. Yay !
- Not tested on mobile !

## Bugs

- Color picker has some weird quirks on cursor
- Selector pasting is offset from one pixel compared to how it looks (just didn't care about fixing it, but it's only because of the borders, and I didn't want to hardfix it)
- Selector doesn't clip drawing properly
- Bucketfill is super super slow and unefficient
- There are some weird design issues with selector
